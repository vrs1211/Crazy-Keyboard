2.HINT : Engineering // reverse of string 
         gnireenigne

1.And thus I clothe my naked villainy
  With old odd ends, stol'n forth of holy writ;
  And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.

2.He who has injured thee was either stronger or weaker than thee. 
  If weaker,then spare him; if stronger, spare thyself. 

3.You must fight conceit, envy, and every kind of ill-feeling in your heart.
  The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent.

4.I don't have a problem believing in God. But in Genesis one has to wonder about these 
  sentences that just go on and end without finishing. The thought is unfinished. 

5.Don't forget that the only two things people read in a story are the first and 
  last sentences. Give them blood in the eye on the first one.

  Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger
  constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
  garnish'd and deck'd in modest compliment,
  not working with the eye without the ear.
  and but in purged judgement trusting neither?

5. FINAL
speed test


I felt the wall of the tunnel shiver. The master alarm squealed through my earphones. 
Almost simultaneously, Jack yelled down to me that there was a warning light on. 
Fleeting but spectacular sights snapped into ans out of view, the snow, the shower of debris, 
the moon, looming close and big, the dazzling sunshine for once unfiltered by layers of air. 
The last twelve hours before re-entry were particular bone-chilling. During this period, 
I had to go up in to command module. Even after the fiery re-entry splashing down in 81 degree
water in south pacific, we could still see our frosty breath inside the command module.
